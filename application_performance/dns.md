## 3. Getting started

### 3.1 Create a full setup zone
Go back to the parent folder of this github repository, edit the `main.py` file with the following code:
```
from client.cf_client import Client

ZONES = [("YOUR_DOMAIN", "full")]

# Create a zone 
dns = Client(scope="dns").get()
dns.create_multiple_zones(account_id="YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID", zones=ZONES)

# Add an A record
dns.create_dns_record(zone_name="YOUR_DOMAIN", type="A", content="76.76.21.21", name="YOUR_DOMAIN") 
```

Export your credentials and execute the script:
```
$ export CF_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
$ export CF_EMAIL="xxxxxx@xyz.yz"

python3 main.py
```

A `zones_output.txt` file will be created containing the value of the nameservers assigned by Cloudflare to your domain. 
Copy the value of those name servers and update your `NS` records on your domain registrar.

Note that the domain propagation can take up to 24h.

### 3.2 Your domain information
```
# Verify that CF nameservers on your domain
$ dig NS +noadditional +noquestion +nocomments +nocmd +nostats YOUR_DOMAIN.

# Check that CF acts as reverse proxy 
# Normally you should CF ips. Your server's identity is hidden
$ dig A +noadditional +noquestion +nocomments +nocmd +nostats YOUR_DOMAIN.
```

### 3.3 Check DDoS mitigation
```
# Generate an instant high traffic on your domain and check the analytics from the dashbord
$ ab -n 10000  https://YOUR_DOMAIN
```
